## Bio

An analytics professional (read: Data Nerd) with a background rooted at the intersection of engineering, science, and finance. I partner with stakeholders to make processes more efficient and solve their complex business problems using rigorous analysis and data. Prior to joining Apple, I worked in specialty tax consulting at BDO USA, LLP. Before that, I graduated from Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo with a blended BS/MS degree in Biomedical Engineering. My professional interests include business analytics, statistics, finance, tech, and leadership development. I also dabble in sports analytics on the side.
